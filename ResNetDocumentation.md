# React Application with ResNet Machine Learning Model

This project is a React application that implements a ResNet50 V2 Machine Learning model for image classification.

## Features

- ResNet50 V2 model for image classification.
- Threshold setting for predictions.
- User-friendly interface for uploading images.
- Detailed output box with prediction results and loading state.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Install all the required packages:

```
npm install
```

Or, if you prefer using yarn:

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

Start the application with:

```
npm start
```

Or, if you prefer using yarn:

```
yarn start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Acknowledgments

This project was created as a demonstration of implementing a machine learning model in a web application using TensorFlow.js and React. It is intended for educational purposes only.

## Notes

- The model loading process may take a while due to the size of the ResNet model (~100MB). A strong network connection is recommended.
- The model's output is a single value, the predicted class. This output is displayed in the ModelOutputBox component.
- The threshold state and handleThresholdChange function are currently not utilized within this component, but are passed to the ModelInputBox component and may be used there.

## Future Work

Future improvements may include optimization for faster model loading and more detailed prediction results.
