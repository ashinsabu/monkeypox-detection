                MobileNet V2 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that
                is designed for efficient image classification on mobile
                devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce
                computation and model size. The model consists of a series of
                convolutional layers followed by depthwise separable
                convolutional layers, which separate spatial and channel-wise
                operations.{" "}

                ResNet50 V2 is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) model,
                which is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN)
                architecture for image classification. It was introduced as an
                improvement over the original ResNet model to further enhance
                its performance.
              </p>
              <p className="info-text">
                The ResNet architecture is known for using residual blocks,
                which address the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in
                deep neural networks. The vanishing gradient problem refers to
                the issue of gradients becoming too small during
                backpropagation, which can hinder the learning process. Residual
                blocks introduce skip connections, also known as shortcut
                connections, that allow for the direct flow of information from
                earlier layers to later layers. This allows the network to
                bypass unnecessary layers and enables training of deeper
                networks with improved gradient flow and reduced degradation in
                performance as the network gets deeper.

                ResNet50V2 specifically consists of 50 layers, including
                convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, activation
                functions (such as Rectified Linear Units or ReLUs), global
                average pooling layers, and fully connected layers. It follows
                the "pre-activation" design, where batch normalization and
                activation functions are applied before the convolutional
                layers, allowing for better convergence during training.

              <h1>Xception</h1>
              <p className="info-text">
                Xception is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
                that was introduced as an extension of the Inception
                architecture, with the goal of improving efficiency and
                performance in image recognition tasks. Xception stands for
                "Extreme Inception," and it leverages depthwise separable
                convolutions, which are a more efficient alternative to
                traditional convolutional operations.
              </p>
              <p className="info-text">
                The key feature of Xception is the use of depthwise separable
                convolutions, which separate the spatial and channel-wise
                operations. In traditional convolutions, the same kernel is
                applied to all input channels, which can be computationally
                expensive. In depthwise separable convolutions, the spatial
                convolution is applied independently to each input channel,
                followed by a pointwise convolution that applies a 1x1
                convolutional kernel to combine the output channels. This
                reduces the number of parameters and computations, resulting in
                a more efficient and compact network architecture.
